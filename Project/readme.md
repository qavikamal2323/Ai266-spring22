### ---------------Qavi kamal---------------
### ----Problem----: Accuracy is 50% after increasing the neighbours , to learn the libraries and parameters of model 
### ----Sol----: So i have taken the best varriance columns(features) fron f-19 to f-28 with 80 20 split ratio 
### then i made a submission good accuracy of 68% with 25 neighbours. To learn the machine leaining stuff 
### i used the google search and youtube to learn which model could be best for the given dataset So the best.
### accuracy we have got in KNN by implementing above parameters and techniques And take the mean of 5 consective 
### values of cross validation.But KNN does'nt give good result on large datasets . Most of the code optimize from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html

## Muhammad Mustafa 
### Problem: Accuracy is 51% with 29 features but then some unimportent features remove which is 3 which increase my accuracy
### Sol: So i made a submission with improve accuracy of 54% what i going through is 27 features with 70 30 split ratio.

## Asad Aslam
### Problem: Accuracy is 58% with 29 features but then some unimportent features remove which increase my accuracy
### Sol: So i made a submission with improve accuracy of 62% what i am going through is 5 features with 80 20 split ratio.
